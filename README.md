Pathfinding
===========
The application is a path finding robot which finds the optimal (shortest) path between the given start and finish points, on a grid based Graphical User Interface. The robot has been provided with the two different algorithms: the A* and Dijkstra, which guarantee to obtain an optimal path. When the robot is provided with A* algorithm, there is an option of choosing between the Manhattan and Chebyshev heuristics. As additional information for the user, the application shows the following information when a path is being calculated: number of operations performed, number of visited nodes, information whether a path was found and additional information when the path is being traversed and forwarded.

Deployment instructions
=======================
The application has been developed and fully tested with Java Runtime Environment 7 and JDK (Java Development Kit) 1.7 version. Additionally the application has been fully tested with JDK compliance 1.6, however the application has turned out to be incompatible with the JDK 1.5 and earlier versions.
